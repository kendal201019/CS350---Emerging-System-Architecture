# CS350---Emerging-System-Architecture

For this portfolio submission, I've chosen two project artifacts that exemplify my proficiency in emerging systems architectures and technologies. These artifacts showcase my ability to develop interface software for hardware control, analyze the impact of hardware architecture on application performance, and justify technology selections based on business needs.

The project focused on creating a smart thermostat using the CC3220S microcontroller, integrating GPIO for LED control, I2C for temperature sensing, and UART for data transmission. The primary goal was to implement a task scheduler to effectively manage these components, ensuring precise temperature regulation and reliable server data reporting.

One particular strength of my approach was the successful implementation of the task scheduler, which facilitated real-time task management such as button monitoring, temperature reading, LED control, and data transmission. This framework enabled precise timing and synchronization of critical operations, enhancing overall system reliability.

Areas for improvement include optimizing resource utilization and enhancing error handling to bolster system robustness. Documenting edge cases and failure scenarios would further fortify reliability under diverse operational conditions.

Throughout the project, I leveraged tools like the TI SimpleLink SDK, integrating drivers for GPIO, I2C, and UART. These resources are now integral to my support network, providing robust libraries and examples that expedited development and troubleshooting.

The skills developed in task scheduling, peripheral integration, and real-time system design are highly transferable. These competencies are applicable across various embedded systems and IoT projects, underscoring their value in future coursework and professional endeavors.

To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I structured the code into modular functions with clear APIs and consistent naming conventions. Detailed comments were added to clarify complex algorithms and facilitate ease of understanding. The system was designed to be adaptable through parameter configuration and scalability for future enhancements.
